# .NET-MVC-C-Web-Application
Work done with Prosper IT Consulting Dev Ops Team

This is the placeholder for live project work done for a Portland Based company called Erectors, Inc.
As a team we built a company Intranet Web Application using C# leveraging the power of .NET frameworks with MVC.
This project included end to end work.


Notes

For my C# Live Projects there were 2 different projects I was able to do work on.

The first sprint was for the file ConstructionNew.sin (I housed it C:\Users\Student\source\repos\ebyrne1230\TechAcademyCSharpLiveProject)

I was able to work on and complete 4 stories

Titles:

EB-4480-ModifyDateDisplay

EB-4481-Back2DashboardLinks

EB-4488-ModifyScheduleIndex

EB-AddForemanFromJobView


Organzing By Story

ModifyDateDisplay

The Story Description:  The schedule start and end dates are currently set to the display mode of yyyy-mm-dd.  This MUST REMAIN the same
so the editors for those dates can get the current value.  Use formatting statements to change the way these dates show up in the various schedule views (ie the dashboard and the index list)  Hint: This most likely needs to be done in the cshtml, but if you can get it to work on the controller side, that would be epic!

So initially for the schedule views, the webpage would display with the yyyy-mm-dd format for each scheduled job.  I was tasked with the challenge to go through the code in the various view pages and adjust the current formatting statements to render the wanted result.

Provide before snippets and after snippets to show the gained resolution.

The changes made were on the Schedule Index view page, the Schedule Details View page, and on the Schedule Delete View page.
